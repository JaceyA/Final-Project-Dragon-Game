#Final Project of Modified Dragon Realm Game
#Group members: Jacey Atkinson and Leovie Lopez
#CIS 202 Final Project 
#This is the modifed version of the Dragon Realm game from Invent with Python.
#It has been adapted so the user can play longer with a player lives system, loss of life for wrong choices, additional cave, and there is not an option to play again.

and will share his treasure with you. The other dragon
is greedy and hungry, and will eat you on sight.
